# Choosing-Best-Machine-Model-for-Weather-Forecast
To provide the best heuristic model to predict the weather conditions using Machine Learning models. In the modern era, weather prediction became one of the most important issues in the world. In previous years there are many models developed to predict the weather conditions, but they did not reach the researchers expectation. Finally, machine learning field made this problem easy. According to the machine learning field, this weather forecasting is a classification problem. So, classification algorithms are the ones that can solve this problem. In particular, logistic regression and random forest algorithms are chosen here to predict weather, as both the algorithms fall under classification algorithms category. The algorithms are applied over the collected dataset and then verified by using GridSearchCV algorithm which uses hyperparameters as its input.
